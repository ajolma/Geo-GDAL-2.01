This is a fork from the Geo-GDAL module that is developed and
distributed as a part of GDAL. For GDAL see http://www.gdal.org/

This fork is for developing the Geo::GDAL CPAN module separately
especially for testing and independent setups. Thus the main
difference is in the build process. The module in GDAL distribution
expects to be built within the GDAL source tree. This module can use
GDAL source or development files from anywhere in the system, or it
can even download and compile GDAL as a part of the build process. If
it downloads and compiles GDAL, it will install the GDAL data files
into a module based share.

This module will be based on the latest released version of GDAL
but may include changes from the trunk. These changes are currently:

* The logic of field names vs. field indexes is done in Perl

* The Driver method Extension returns a processed DMD_EXTENSIONS

* PDL support

* GeoTransform.Apply adjusts to point in addition to points

* Fix for GeoTransform.Inv

* Fix for Layer.SpatialReference

* Detect 64bit Integer fields in Feature.SetField

* Fix for connectedness in Band.Polygonize
